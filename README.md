Please be kind this is my first ever Node API I know that i have clustered my index.js file and should have made routes instead but I started with no prior 
experience with node and When I realized I made a mess it was so big that I didn't really wanted to fix it up.

But I promise I will.

And I will stop storing JWT's in Cookies I promise.
